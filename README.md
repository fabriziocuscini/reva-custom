# Reva

Design system, component library, and application platform for Reva, an AI-enabled wealth management infrastructure.

## Overview

This monorepo contains the full Reva design system and product platform:

- **`packages/design-tokens`** (`@reva/tokens`): Platform-agnostic, multi-themeable design token system. Authored in Tokens Studio format, transformed via Style Dictionary into CSS, TypeScript, W3C JSON, and React Native outputs.
- **`packages/panda-preset`** (`@reva/panda-preset`): Panda CSS preset bridging design tokens into the styling system. Manages base theme, client themes (white-labelling), light/dark mode conditions, and all component recipes.
- **`packages/ui`** (`@reva/ui`): React component library built on Ark UI (headless) and Panda CSS (styling). Anatomy-first, fully typed, accessible by default.
- **`packages/config`** (`@reva/config`): Shared ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript configurations.
- **`apps/docs`** (`@reva/docs`): Documentation site built with Fumadocs and Next.js.
- **`apps/website-static`** (`@reva/website-static`): Current static marketing site (Vite + PostCSS + PostHTML).
- **`apps/advisor-portal`** (`@reva/advisor-portal`): Advisor-facing web portal (Vite + React).
- **`apps/client-portal`** (`@reva/client-portal`): End-client web portal, white-labelled per advisory firm (Vite + React).
